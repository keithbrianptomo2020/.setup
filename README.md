# dotfiles

[![Build Status](https://github.com/yardnsm/dotfiles/workflows/main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yardnsm/dotfiles/actions)

These are my dotfiles. A collection of zsh, git, vim and macOS configurations. I built this repo
from scratch, while focus on organization.

## Installation

Simply run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/yardnsm/dotfiles ~/dotfiles

# Run the installation script
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./.setup/dots --init
```

## Order and hierarchy

- Every non-hidden directory is considered as a "topic". A topic can have an `install.sh` file that
  will run when installing the dotfiles.
- [`.symlinks`](./.symlinks) contains a list of the directories / files to symlink.
- `init.zsh` files inside each topic will be sourced when the shell loads.

## `dots`

[`dots`](./.setup/dots) is an executable for managing the dotfiles. It will manage every topic's
installation. You can pass some options to exclude certain topics from installation, or set specific
topics to install.

```
